# Reagenzglaslaeufer

This is a makerspace student project. Its main aim is to repair a ... device...

Only the old electric motor is defective. It is replaced by a stepper motor. 

For monitoring microbiological growth, a sensor for the oclusion density (OD) of the liquid in the test tubes is added. The data is sent to a nearby PC.

The ... Drehscheibe usw. ... is rebuilt from scratch in order to allow the OD measurements.

The project involves progamming, electronics, 3D CAD, 3D printing, Lasercutting and more.

Some specific programs and devices used in this project: Arduino IDE, ESP32, Inventor, NEMA 23 stepper motor, FDM 3D Printer with about 300 x 300 bed, China Lasercutter
