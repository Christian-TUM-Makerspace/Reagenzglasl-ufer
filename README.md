# Tissue-Culture Rotator - repair and OD measuring

## Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to repair a New Brunswick Scientific TC-7. It is a makerspace student project. 

Only the old electric motor of Tissue-Culture Rotator is defective. It is replaced by a stepper motor. 

For monitoring microbiological growth, a sensor for the oclusion density (OD) of the liquid in the test tubes is added. The data is sent to a nearby PC.

The wheel is rebuilt from scratch in order to allow the OD measurements.

OD measurements will only work, if the slent is high (wenn der Apparat sehr schräg gestellt ist). With 5 ml in a test tube, you need to put something under the adjustment screw additionally (etwas unter die Einstellschraube legen, um den Apparat schräger zu stellen).

The project involves progamming, electronics, 3D CAD, 3D printing, Lasercutting and more.

Some specific programs, devices etc. used in this project: 
Arduino IDE, [FastAccelStepper library](https://github.com/gin66/FastAccelStepper), ESP32, Inventor, China Lasercutter.

## Lessons learned

Maybe it would have been easier to use an other type of motor.

In Inventor, set the dependencies carefully. Otherwise it can become almost impossible to change the model.

It is hard to find fitting timing belt pulleys. Especially if you work in Europe and repair a US device.
