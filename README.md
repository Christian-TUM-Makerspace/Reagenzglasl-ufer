# Reagenzglaslaeufer

## Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to repair a new brunswick scientific rotator tc7. It is a makerspace student project. 

Only the old electric motor of the ... is defective. It is replaced by a stepper motor. 

For monitoring microbiological growth, a sensor for the oclusion density (OD) of the liquid in the test tubes is added. The data is sent to a nearby PC.

The ... Drehscheibe usw. ... is rebuilt from scratch in order to allow the OD measurements.

The project involves progamming, electronics, 3D CAD, 3D printing, Lasercutting and more.

Some specific programs, devices etc. used in this project: 
Arduino IDE, Python, ESP32, Inventor, FDM 3D Printer with about 300 x 300 bed, China Lasercutter.
